# Quiz-Game

## Description

For a hands-on approach at practicing JavaScript fundamentals, I was tasked to create a timed quiz. I wanted to have some fun with it so I made a short  Pokémon game. You will be shown an image of a Pokémon, and the player has to guess the name. 

## Usage

[Quiz Game](https://marniluka.github.io/Pokemon-Quiz-Game/)

When first opening the site, you will see a simple explanation on the game. When you click the "Start!" button, you will be shown the first questions, and a timer of 60 seconds will appear in the top right corner. When you get an answer wrong, 10 seconds will be deducted from the timer, and your score will be however many seconds are left.

When you answer a question, regardless of whether the answer is correct or not, the following question will take it's place, and you will be shown if you got question right or wrong.

Upon completion of the quiz, you can submit your name and save your score to the scoreboard. You can access this scoreboard at any time as it is linked in the top left corner.

## Credits
The tutor Jili Jiang was a great help! I had some trouble with writting the function of going through the quiz array I made, especially with having the proper image and having the different answer choices show up. She also helped me fix some parts of my code that wasn't working properly.


## Extra
The localStorage is having some issues that I wasn't able to fix in time. 
Also made multiple CSS pages to make it easier to style each page individually. Can probably be condensed later as there are multiple repeating patterns accross them.
